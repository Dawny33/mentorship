# Curriculum

Please read `What to teach` and `Curriculum` section from [mentors-guide](../mentors-guide.md).

At the minimum the curriculum should include an online course/youtube playlist which covers following topics and a beginner friendly book:

- basics (includes introduction, installing IDE, installing language packages etc)
- variables
- basic data types: String, Integer
- Control statements: if, else
- Looping statements: for
- Functions: function definitions, parameters, function calling, return statement

**Note**: If you are teaching something else than a programming, like `algorithms`, `linux` etc you can come up with own curriculum structure.
